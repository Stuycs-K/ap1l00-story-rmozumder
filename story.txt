Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no drugs
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on myself, I thought I would <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> about
a little and see the <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> part of the city. It is a way I have of driving off the
crazy fans and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the lack of anime;
whenever it is a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>, <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> November in my one billion dollar condo; whenever I find myself involuntarily
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> before coffin morning>, and bringing up the rear of every horse I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> into the jail, and methodically
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> people's trees off—then, I account it high time to get to the jungle as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all people in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the whiteboards with me.
